The Mushroom Mechanic 

The game mechanic I will be creating for coding task 2 is for my comp150 group project. It will be called the mushroom mechanic, the mushroom mechanic is the end game goal for the player. The player will need to collect(Walk over) the mushroom to complete the level, when the player does this it should notify the player that they have won the level, it should also bring up a button that will let the player choose whether they want to restart the level.
